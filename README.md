# Compiler-Construction Lab Assignment

[LAB 1]()
I built a simple lexical analyser using python. Using a simple code declaration as an exmaple,'int result = 100', the program tokenizes the code.

[LAB 2]()
The second assignent was to describe the output of a lexical analyzer,
using the lexical analyzer created in [lab 1]().
The output generated is:
[['KEYWORD', 'int'], ['IDENTIFIER', 'result'], ['OPERATOR', '='], ['INTEGER', '10']]
'10']]

The scanner identified four tokens from the sample code.
